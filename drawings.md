### Drawings by Italian students

Before a presentation called "The mysteries of planet formation: Planets and binary stars", the students of this Italian school located in Alba Adriatica were asked to prepare some scientific drawings. These are all the instructions they received:

>"Planets exist in system with two stars. Imagine and draw the kind of orbits they could have."

With their permission, I share some of them below:

- Abel Osagie, 3ยบ, scuola di Alba Adriatica, 19/01/2022

I was very impressed by theire spectacular drawings. Also, this was a great opportunity the physics behind the orbits. Upon inspection, many questions immediately arise from these drawings:
- Can we have misaligned orbits around binary stars?
- Why are orbits eccentric? Is this configuration stable?
- What is the difference between circumstellar and circumbinary planets?
- Can we have planets on the same orbit (aka Trojan planets)?
- Are these planetary systems similar to the Solar System?
