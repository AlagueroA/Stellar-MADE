We plan to work on 4 main axes during the meeting: 
- Distribution, environment and evolution of discs: multiples vs. singles.
- Disc diagnostics (morphology, kinematics and accretion) within multiples.
- Dust evolution in multiples and flybys: G/D ratio, radial drift, traps, asymmetries.
- Strategy to better characterise discs and orbits with new generation facilities.

All these topics explicitly overlap and will be discussed during the meeting. Each participant
will preferentially work on one item with a subgroup of participants. At the end, we will establish
a plan to keep working together after the meeting, share results efficiently, and co-write the
corresponding scientific articles.

Practical information:
- Tuesday: Travel to Grenoble train/bus station or IPAG.
- Tuesday: Start of the meeting at Hôtel des Playes.
- Wednesday: Short presentations on the axes & work in groups.
- Thursday: Work in groups and half-day free outdoors.
- Friday: Wrap-up and strategy discussion for the future.
